# Snake AI project:

My project to start working with ML algorithms. This is a program using a deep reinforcement learning to play a snake game.

## Dependencies

- python 3.7.2
- pygame
- numpy

## How to run

For now, run test.py

## Issues

- According to this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-teach-an-ai-to-play-games-deep-reinforcement-learning-28f9b920440a), there can be results of 45 in only 150 games.<br />
I ran the test more than 1000 and did not get a highscore greater than 3...
I'm not sure if it is because my environment variables (alpha, gamma and epsilon) are wrong or if the whole flow is wrong.
